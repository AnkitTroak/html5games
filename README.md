# html5games
A real money html5 games platform built with Htm5, Jquery, Firebase and Nodejs.
I have built this during covid lockdown to learn some new technologoes.
I loved the way Gamezop has created the product and it inspired me to build a simillar open source version of it. 
This project is free to use, but ensure that you give credit to me. 
I have used Firebase for both hosting and Backend. Razorpay as payment gateway. 
You can register on both the platfroms to get your keys to create your own. 
The backend cloud functions are included in this project with name cloudfunctions.js. This is used run Cron Jobs and backend functions to end the tournament and pay prize money to the winners and other backend functions to add wallet balance etc. 
I may not have time to contribute to this project but will try to contribute when ever I get time. If you are willing to contribute to this project please write to me.
This a progressive web app, built to function on all the mobile browsers. 
All the best for you project.
